# UX / UI Design 
Focus on user experience (UX) flow first — wireframes, mockups, user journeys.
(How should users interact with it?)

Then user interface (UI) — final visuals, style guides, and prototypes (e.g., Figma).

Should happen in parallel or right after system design, so front-end dev knows what to build.

to-dos:
Define UX goals and explain its quality components. 

Explain the UX process. 

Evaluate interactive designs and create a modern user interface. 


Identify applications of UI designs. 


Create a Figma account. 

Explore how to use the layers panel in Figma. 

Identify how to duplicate, scale, group and align elements. 

Create a responsive grid system. 

Describe the concepts of wireframing. 

Design wireframes using Figma. 

Define usability testing. 

Describe the different types of usability testing.
 They are learnability - easy to learn from the first time they do it, efficiency -  users want to change their order? Is it easy to do, and can they do it quickly and efficiently?, memorability -  Is it easy to remember where they were when they return? How quickly can they find where they were?, errors -  What if a user makes a mistake? The design should provide solutions to these mistakes and address ther before they happen., and satisfaction -  Is the website pleasant or satisfying to use? Do users enjoy using it?.
