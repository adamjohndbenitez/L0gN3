Prompt:
When you create a file in github without a file extension,
Does the file have a default file extension it assign to?

ChatGPT:
Short answer: **No. GitHub does not automatically assign a default file extension.**

Here’s what actually happens:

### ✅ When you create a file on GitHub with **no extension**:

* GitHub will create it **exactly as you name it**.
* If you name a file `example`, it becomes a file literally called `example`—no `.txt`, no `.md`, nothing.
* GitHub does **not infer or add** an extension.
* The file will be treated as a **plain text file** when viewed in the UI, unless its contents match a known format (e.g., JSON), in which case GitHub might apply syntax highlighting—but **the filename remains extensionless**.

### Examples

| File name you create | Actual stored file name | GitHub adds extension? |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `readme`             | `readme`                | ❌ No                   |
| `config`             | `config`                | ❌ No                   |
| `deploy`             | `deploy`                | ❌ No                   |

### How GitHub decides syntax highlighting

If the file has **no extension**, GitHub attempts to guess the language using:

* the file contents
* the GitHub Linguist library

…but **this does not change the filename**.

### Summary

* GitHub never assigns a default extension.
* A file with no extension stays that way.
* Syntax highlighting may occur, but doesn’t create an extension.

If you want the file treated as a specific type, you must explicitly add the extension yourself (e.g., `.txt`, `.md`, `.sh`, etc.).
