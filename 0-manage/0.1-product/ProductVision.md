cryptography vs crypto blockchain vs cipher vs crypt
(frm Google AI Overview)
Cryptography is the overarching science of securing communication and data from unauthorized access. A cipher is an algorithm used within cryptography for the specific tasks of encrypting (encoding) and decrypting (decoding) information. Blockchain is a technology that leverages cryptography to secure a distributed digital ledger. Crypto is a common shorthand term used both for "cryptography" and, more frequently, "cryptocurrency," while "crypt" is not a standard term in this context. 
Here is a detailed breakdown of each term:
Cryptography
Cryptography (or cryptology) is the field of study and practice that uses mathematical principles and algorithms to protect information and communications. Its main goals are to ensure: 
Confidentiality: Ensuring only the intended recipient can read the data.
Integrity: Confirming the data has not been altered.
Authentication: Verifying the identity of the sender and recipient.
Nonrepudiation: Proving the sender provided the data and cannot deny it. 
Cipher
A cipher is a specific set of rules or an algorithm used to perform encryption and decryption. 
It takes readable data, called plaintext, and a key (a piece of information that controls the cipher's operation) to produce unintelligible ciphertext.
Examples include the historical Caesar cipher and modern standards like the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). 
Blockchain
Blockchain is a specific type of distributed, immutable digital ledger technology that uses cryptographic principles to secure its data. 
How it uses cryptography:
Hashing is used to create a unique, fixed-length digital fingerprint of each block's data. Each new block contains the hash of the previous block, creating a "chain" that is tamper-resistant.
Asymmetric (public-key) cryptography is used to manage ownership and verify transactions, allowing users to sign transactions with a private key and others to verify them with a public key.
It is a product of cryptography, not a type of cryptography itself. 
Crypto
"Crypto" is a ubiquitous colloquial abbreviation used in two main contexts:
Cryptography: Used as a shorthand for the general field of study (e.g., "crypto security").
Cryptocurrency: Most commonly refers to digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are built on blockchain technology and, therefore, rely heavily on cryptography. 
Crypt
"Crypt" is generally not a recognized technical term within the context of information security or blockchain and is likely a misspelling of "crypto" or "cipher".
