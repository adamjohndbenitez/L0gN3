## About Me & My Projects
I am AJ, a software developer with over 10 years of experience spanning Canadian and Filipino tech industries. This GitHub repository hosts a long-term, passion-driven hobby project where I bring ideas stemming from my professional background to life.
My recent work in a cybersecurity company instilled a "security-first" mindset, particularly concerning sensitive personal data like government IDs, banking information, and passwords. I believe in the need to securely manage, track, and consolidate essential life data—covering health, finance, and personal notes—in a single, protected location.
To add a creative flourish and share my love for storytelling, Pokémon, and non-fictional epics like Lord of the Rings, I name my projects after mythical creatures:
 - Life Log Man ("Life Logging Management"): The foundational project is a titanic, tree-like entity that grows stronger by documenting life experiences (personal logs, health logs, financial logs). It functions as a robust management system offering various templates for comprehensive life tracking.
 - Stealthagon: The second creature is a dragon with a body of virtually indestructible Polygon mineral crystals, resembling a black "Night Fury" with scanning midnight-blue eyes. Its wings double as shields, and its burgundy maple leaf tail provides balance in flight—symbolizing a secure, elegant, and balanced data protection system.
ArtilliGenie: The final creature is an intelligent entity, much like the Genie from Aladdin, designed to listen to user input and intelligently automate or execute numerous complex tasks and "wishes" within the ecosystem.

It really depends on your imagination...
