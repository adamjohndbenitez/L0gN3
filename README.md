## Description
mini scratch simple personal project that focus on range of web, mobile, data security, ai. implementation with modern tech-stacks (front-end, back-end, api, database, etc.). Covers broad focus on architecture and holistic engineering process. Forme, myself, This will maybe my forever project.

## About Me
I am AJ. I have 10+ years of Software Development Experience (Canadian + Filipino). This project is my lifetime hobby project. Based on industrial experience some ideas come out of my mind. Since my last company is a cyber security company, my intuitive thinking about data is security first specially the sensitive personal data like government id, banking info, passwords. So sometimes our lives we need to keep track and monitor of these data, including health & finance. One thing about me is, I love story telling. and I love pokemon creatures, non-fictional movie like Lord of the Rings. So to hype up this project, I name my project based from mythical creatures that I have in mind. 1st creature is a man that transform into a big colossal Titanic gargantuan tree that grow logs everyday since its a plant. it gets stronger when it learns life experiences or factor. for now, personal logs, health logs, financial logs. I named this creature Life Log Man ("Life Logging Management"). In the product perspective, it has templates for different logs of life like notes, health, money. 2nd creature is a dragon that transform its body into Polygon mineral crystals that is stronger than metals. that is color black just like night-fury from How to Train your dragon. it has a midnight blue eyes that can scan anything onsight in darkness. it's wings can serve into shield if someone attacks it. it's fishtail is color burgundy. 
In fashion, a "fishtail" refers to a dress or skirt silhouette that is fitted through the hips and knees before dramatically flaring out at the hem, resembling a mermaid or fish tail. "Burgundy" is the color, a deep red, and when combined with the fishtail design, creates a glamorous, elegant, and sometimes dramatic effect. While the color burgundy adds to the **sophisticated** and bold nature of the style, the fishtail is the defining feature of the garment's cut and shape. fishtail also resembles balance when it is in flight. it's name is Stealthagon. Final mythical creature is a genie just like in Aladdin it listens to you and that grants 3 wishes, but this one is not just 3wishes to grant and grants many wishes. it's a very intelligent creature.


## User Requirements and ~~Business~~ Project Goals
A user will be able to login and log into his life log app. This app targets the end users log whether it is for personal notes, action required check list, time management like timeline (static content), time box (interactive),  keeping passwords in a safe place like a securing it in vault, and also targets health care data like high blood pressure hypertension logging, or sugar level glucose monitoring, daily intake of maintenance medicine (notification). As well as logging personal budgets and expenses tracking. It helps the user to secure and protect his sensitive data, help monitor health, and help track finances. These are the (3) main temples of this life log app. And building more templates.

# System design and Architecture 

## Establish Scope
List of follow up Questions?
1. What are specific Features?
- app: lifelog - notes - highblood pressure logs - sugar level logs - password keeper - and many more templates
- sec: encrypt/decrypt - masking - tokenization options for sensitive data (password keeper)
- ai: animation button - train on test data - ml - nlp
- ai: mascot called "archintel" 
- theme can change into dark theme / light theme / constrast + AODA (color blind)
- template: countdown timer / day timer (notification) / action required checklist + notif + unchecked (how old is the item left undone, display created. notification-level controls(delete, done, view)
- template: itenirary/tour/trip planner + leeway + notification
- template: table sheet (listing, drag&drop items, highlight row or column) it has filter/sort feature a-z/0-9 
- template: carnet notebook (routine, daily sheets, weekly, monthly sheet, goals, budget planner, expenses tracker,
- template: a student may want to practice exam and quizzes. a template in mind that can input question and answer, format would be multiple choices (a,b,c,d) or a identification exam.
Notes: 
A _quiz_ is a short, informal assessment of a specific, recent topic, while a _test_ is a more comprehensive and formal evaluation of a larger unit or chapter. An _exam_ is the most formal and significant assessment, typically covering all or a major portion of the course material for a final grade. Essentially, it’s a hierarchy of formality and scope, with quiz < test < exam. 
- Technologies in mind: react (web/mobile), sprint boot (backend), rust (security), ai (python), analytics (vue.js), cloud infra (aws/gcp)

2. How many users?
3. What are the anticipated scales in 1 month, 3 or 6 months?
4. What are the company technology stack?

## Frame high-lvl blueprint system design
1. Key components in box diagram
2. How large the problem space?

## Delve Deeper into Details
1. deep dive into system components (eg. hash fuction, reduce latency..)
2. Focus on bottlenecks & resource estimation

## Recap / Refinements
1. Bottlenecks 
2. Potential Improvements
3. Errors cases (server failure, network logs)
4. Monitor metrics
5. Next scale curve

# UX / UI Design 
Focus on user experience (UX) flow first — wireframes, mockups, user journeys.
(How should users interact with it?)

Then user interface (UI) — final visuals, style guides, and prototypes (e.g., Figma).

Should happen in parallel or right after system design, so front-end dev knows what to build.

to-dos:
Define UX goals and explain its quality components. 

Explain the UX process. 

Evaluate interactive designs and create a modern user interface. 


Identify applications of UI designs. 


Create a Figma account. 

Explore how to use the layers panel in Figma. 

Identify how to duplicate, scale, group and align elements. 

Create a responsive grid system. 

Describe the concepts of wireframing. 

Design wireframes using Figma. 

Define usability testing. 

Describe the different types of usability testing.
 They are learnability - easy to learn from the first time they do it, efficiency -  users want to change their order? Is it easy to do, and can they do it quickly and efficiently?, memorability -  Is it easy to remember where they were when they return? How quickly can they find where they were?, errors -  What if a user makes a mistake? The design should provide solutions to these mistakes and address ther before they happen., and satisfaction -  Is the website pleasant or satisfying to use? Do users enjoy using it?.

Recognize how to use and  images, colors and shapes. 

Explain the role of images, colors and shapes in design. 

Name and explain what design systems and UI kits are. 

Differentiate between design systems and UI kits. 

Explain best practice design for design systems and UI kits.

Describe how these prototypes are animated and shared.

Identify how to use user interviews and observations. 

Explore a customer journey map. 

Identify tools in user research. 

Describe the role of user research tools in the empathize stage.

Describe and Explain how the evaluation methodologies can be applied to improve your designs. 

Create a paper prototype wireframe. 

Design a prototype for a new table reservation flow in Figma. 

Write a test script based on your wireframe and prototype.
