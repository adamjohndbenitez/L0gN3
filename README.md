## Description
mini scratch simple personal project that focus on range of web, mobile, data security, ai. implementation with modern tech-stacks (front-end, back-end, api, database, etc.). Covers broad focus on architecture and engineering process.

## User Requirements and Business Goals
A user will be able to login and log into his life log app. This app targets the end users log whether it is for personal notes, action required check list, keeping passwords in a safe place like a securing it in vault, and also targets health care data like high blood pressure hypertension logging, or sugar level glucose monitoring, daily intake of maintenance medicine (notification). As well as logging personal budgets and expenses tracking. It helps the user to work on his sensitive data, help monitor health, and help track finances. These are the main temples of this life log app.

# System design and Architecture 

## Establish Scope
List of follow up Questions?
1. What are specific Features?
- app: lifelog - notes - highblood pressure logs - sugar level logs - password keeper - and many more templates
- sec: encrypt/decrypt - masking - tokenization options for sensitive data (password keeper)
- ai: animation button - train on test data - ml - nlp
- ai: mascot called "archintel" 
- theme can change into dark theme / light theme / constrast + AODA (color blind)
- template: countdown timer / day timer (notification) / action required checklist + notif + unchecked (how old is the item left undone, display created. notification-level controls(delete, done, view)
- template: itenirary/tour/trip planner + leeway + notification
- template: table sheet (listing, drag&drop items, highlight row or column) it has filter/sort feature a-z/0-9 
- template: carnet notebook (routine, daily sheets, weekly, monthly sheet, goals, budget planner, expenses tracker,
- Technologies in mind: react (web/mobile), sprint boot (backend), rust (security), ai (python), analytics (vue.js), cloud infra (aws/gcp)

2. How many users?
3. What are the anticipated scales in 1 month, 3 or 6 months?
4. What are the company technology stack?

## Frame high-lvl blueprint
1. Key components in box diagram
2. How large the problem space?

## Dig into Details
1. deep dive into system components (eg. hash fuction, reduce latency..)
2. Focus on bottlenecks & resource estimation

## Recap / Refinements
1. Errors Logs
2. Monitor metrics

# UX / UI Design 
Focus on user experience (UX) flow first — wireframes, mockups, user journeys.
(How should users interact with it?)

Then user interface (UI) — final visuals, style guides, and prototypes (e.g., Figma).

Should happen in parallel or right after system design, so front-end dev knows what to build.

to-dos:
Define UX goals and explain its quality components. 

Explain the UX process. 

Evaluate interactive designs and create a modern user interface. 


Identify applications of UI designs. 


Create a Figma account. 

Identify how to use user interviews and observations. 

Explore a customer journey map. 

Identify tools in user research. 

Describe the role of user research tools in the empathize stage.
